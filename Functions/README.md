Understanding Function in Python 

 This is an introduction to functions, a fundamental building block in Python programming. 
 - Functions help organize code, improve readability and promote re-useability of codes. 

Functions are reuseable block of codes that perform specific tasks only when called. 
 - Two steps in functions 
  1. define the function 
  2. call function (invoke function)

 - To create a function, use the keyword 'def' followed by the name you want to give the function. 
 - Basic syntax 
   def function_name(parameter):
     function
    return expression
